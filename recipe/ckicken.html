   </ul><li>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</li>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
     <li>Step 1</li>
     <p> Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.</p>
      
     <li>step 2</li>
        <p> Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</p>
     <li> Step 3</li>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate. </p>
     <li>step4</li>
       <p>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.</p>
       <li>step 5</li>
       <p> Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</p>
    <li> Step 6</li>
       <p>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce. </p>
    <li>step 7</li>
      <p>Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</p>
